Sale Price Histogram

manufacturerMeanSalesPriceByQty
- A few notable manufacturers

multipleSales
- In 26240 obs 288 machines were resold, in 77 (27%) of these resales the sale price decreased, 173 (60%) increased and 38 (13%) stayed the same

saleByAuctioneer
- Number of bulldozers sold by each auctioneer is comparable (~2000), but mean sales price has a wide range. Auctioneer (seller) is surprisingly predictive - why would this be? Reps from companies talking up buyers before the auction? Or sellers have differing reputations on providing quality machines, accurate descriptions of conditions, etc.? 

Ideas:

X Mean by month
X Mean by season
