DATA PREP
Separating training data into 2 sets to get a sense of accuracy
Uses caret package
20% testing.csv
80% training.csv

SUBMISSION 1
Prediction based on gender
Working through the python tutorial at kaggle, converting to R
http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/details/getting-started-with-python
kaggle 0.76555

SUBMISSION 2
Random Forest
Working through the getting started with random forests at kaggle, converting to R
http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/details/getting-started-with-random-forests
kaggle 0.77512

SUBMISSION 3
Generalized Linear Model 
Uses glm to predict survived using same clean data from sub2
kaggle 0.76555

SUBMISSION 4
Random Forest
Re-cleaning data, retaining Cabin and Ticket data and predicting fills instead of using means
accuracy on cleaned train data (all): ~94%
kaggle 0.727272


Ideas:
Clean data using prediction instead of means
Include ticket and cabin data
Logistic regression using model taught in Machine Learning
Neural Network
SVM
