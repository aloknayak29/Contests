SUBMISSION 3
Generalized Linear Model 
Uses glm to predict survived using same clean data from sub2

SUBMISSION 4
Logistic Regression
Uses model taught in Prof. Ng's Machine Learning

Ideas:
Clean data using prediction instead of means
Logistic regression using model taught in Machine Learning
Neural Network
SVM
